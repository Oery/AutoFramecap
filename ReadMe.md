_A Hollow Knight mod that automatically enables framecap in certain areas_

> If you're on Linux, you should probably just use [gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) instead.
> For example, I run my game using `gamescope -W 1920 -H 1080 -r 1000 -e --expose-wayland --adaptive-sync -- %command%`

## Why does this mod exist and what does it fix ?

If you like to record gameplay or simply like to play on really high framerates, you might have encountered situations where your game/recording becomes very laggy in some areas. This mod address this issue by enabling the in game framecap in problematic scenes so you can enjoy playing uncapped everywhere else.

> [!NOTE]
> The ingame framecaps caps the FPS at 400. If you don't get more than this, this mod will be absolutely useless.
