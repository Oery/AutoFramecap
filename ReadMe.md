# AutoFramecap
_A Hollow Knight mod that automatically enables framecap in certain areas_

## Why does this mod exist and what does it fix ?

If you like to record gameplay or simply like to play on really high framerates, you might have encountered situations where your game/recording becomes very laggy in some areas. This mod address this issue by enabling the in game framecap in problematic scenes so you can enjoy playing uncapped everywhere else.

> [!NOTE]
> The ingame framecaps caps the FPS at 400. If you don't get more than this, this mod will be absolutely useless.

## My situation

I run the game on Linux and average around 600 to 700 frames per second, which is god tier in term of responsiveness, but sadly, some rooms make my PC cry and results in not only very poor performances but also visual glitches when recording/streaming. Since I would have to turn the framecap on anyway to prevent it, I decided to simply make this mod to manage this automatically instead.
